## Project Overview
WHAT EXACTLY IS FREQy PHOENIX?: A Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) Emitter Recognition application that utilizes six different machine learning algorithms to identify systems based on their parameters. FREQy PHOENIX recommends algorithms based on trained data and exports formatted reports based on user settings.

This project is a culmination of skills acquired in the GalvanizeData & Development Immersive program. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict an output based on provided numerical and/or categorical inputs and identify where automation can be applied to common tasks.

## Original Data
-

## Exploratory Analysis
-

## Machine Learning
Six different classification model were trained on the synthetic data.
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## Live Predictions
Select parameters in the sidebar to view the predictions in the main window <br>

## Automated Reporting
The app uses the information in each row combined with the probability of accuracy to generate unique reports exportable to .CSV <br>
Use the sidebar controls to filter what date range or any specific functions you would like to export. The ML algorithm selected will be applied for your final result.
